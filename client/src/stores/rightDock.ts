/**
 * The right edge has two docks.
 *
 * The *outer* dock is the browser panel. It tiles: both the sidebar and the
 * coordinator read `browserPanelWidth` and offset themselves by it, so the
 * browser sitting alongside either of them is deliberate and stays.
 *
 * The *inner* dock is shared by the sidebar and the coordinator, and holds
 * exactly one of them. Both render at the same `right` with the same top and
 * bottom, so opening both does not tile — the sidebar's z-50 covers the
 * coordinator's z-40 completely. The coordinator stays mounted, keeps polling
 * its snapshot every 1.5s, and the header button still reads as active, with
 * nothing on screen to say so.
 *
 * Opening either panel is done by calling its setter directly from a dozen
 * call sites across the app (the header, the command palette, keyboard
 * shortcuts, the activity center, session selection, terminal links), and the
 * two flags live in different stores. Enforcing the invariant by subscription
 * covers every one of those without either store importing the other, and
 * covers call sites added later.
